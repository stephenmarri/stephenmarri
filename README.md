### Hello there... ðŸ‘‹

### This is Stephen.

I am an [**Automation Engineer**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenmarri) by profession, but that doesn't limit me eeh!!! I am interested in everything related to computer science.

Check out some of the games and projects that I've tried.
<br>Below you'll find a few projects that I built while learning to program primarily in JavaScript & Python.
<br>You can check out my GitHub repositories [here](https://github.com/stephenmarri).
